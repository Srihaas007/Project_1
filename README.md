# Project_1

The project aims to develop a sophisticated chatbot application leveraging LLaMA 3, an open-source language model from Facebook. This chatbot will be integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, enhancing its ability to generate relevant and context-aware responses by retrieving and utilizing pertinent information from a document repository. The backend, featuring the chatbot API, will be hosted on AWS to ensure scalability and reliability. Concurrently, a simple notice board will be developed using React Native to interact seamlessly with the chatbot. This collaborative effort involves backend development, DevOps for deployment, and frontend design, resulting in a robust, integrated solution for intelligent document processing and user interaction.

### Project Overview

The project aims to develop a sophisticated base chatbot application leveraging LLaMA 3, an open-source language model from Facebook. This chatbot will be integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, enhancing its ability to generate relevant and context-aware responses by retrieving and utilizing pertinent information from a document repository. The backend, featuring the chatbot API, will be hosted on AWS to ensure scalability and reliability. Concurrently, a simple notice board will be developed using React Native to interact seamlessly with the chatbot. This phase of the project focuses on establishing the core functionalities, laying the groundwork for future expansions and customizations.

### Designing the Data Ingestion for a Customizable Chatbot API

Given the project goal of creating a base chatbot model that can be personalized for multiple users, it's crucial to design an efficient and flexible data ingestion pipeline. This will allow users to provide their data, train personalized models, and deploy them as needed.

### Steps for Designing the Data Ingestion and Model Customization Pipeline

1. **Base Model Training:**
   - Train a robust base model using a large, diverse dataset covering various general topics and questions. This model will serve as the foundation for all personalized chatbots.

2. **Data Ingestion API:**
   - Create an API endpoint for users to upload their data. This data can be in various formats such as text, CSV, Excel, images, etc. Ensure the API can handle different data types and sizes efficiently.

3. **Data Processing and Storage:**
   - Upon receiving the data, preprocess it to clean and format it appropriately. Store the processed data securely, associating it with the respective user.

4. **Fine-Tuning Pipeline:**
   - Develop a pipeline for fine-tuning the base model on the user-provided data. This pipeline should:
     - Extract relevant features from the data.
     - Handle different data formats appropriately.
     - Fine-tune the base model with minimal user intervention.

5. **Model Deployment:**
   - Once fine-tuning is complete, deploy the personalized model for the user. Provide an API endpoint for the user to interact with their chatbot.

### Data Ingestion and Processing

**Types of Data and Preprocessing Steps:**

1. **Text Data:**
   - **Formats:** Plain text, PDFs, Word documents, JSON, HTML.
   - **Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, entity recognition.

2. **Numerical and Categorical Data:**
   - **Formats:** CSV files, Excel sheets, databases.
   - **Preprocessing:** Normalization, handling missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical data.

3. **Image Data:**
   - **Formats:** PNG, JPEG, TIFF.
   - **Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, augmentation.

4. **Audio Data:**
   - **Formats:** WAV, MP3.
   - **Preprocessing:** Feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs), noise reduction.

5. **Combined Data:**
   - Handle multi-modal data by processing each type individually and then combining the features.

### API Design for Data Ingestion

**Example API Endpoints:**

- **Upload Data:**
  ```http
  POST /api/upload
  Content-Type: multipart/form-data
  Body: {
    "file": <file>, // Supports various formats
    "metadata": { "user_id": "12345", "data_type": "text/csv/image" }
  }
  ```

- **Start Fine-Tuning:**
  ```http
  POST /api/fine-tune
  Body: {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "parameters": { "epochs": 5, "learning_rate": 0.001 }
  }
  ```

- **Get Chatbot Response:**
  ```http
  POST /api/chat
  Body: {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "query": "What is the weather like today?"
  }
  ```

### Implementation Outline

1. **Base Model Training:**
   - Use a large, diverse dataset to train a robust base chatbot model.
   - Save the model's architecture and weights for future fine-tuning.

2. **Data Ingestion Service:**
   - Implement an API using a web framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI).
   - Store uploaded data in a cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3).

3. **Preprocessing and Storage:**
   - Create preprocessing scripts for different data types.
   - Store preprocessed data in a database or file storage.

4. **Fine-Tuning Pipeline:**
   - Use a machine learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) to fine-tune the base model.
   - Automate the fine-tuning process to run on user-provided data.

5. **Model Deployment:**
   - Deploy the fine-tuned model using a model serving framework (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe).
   - Provide an API endpoint for users to interact with their personalized chatbot.

### Example Project Workflow

1. **User uploads data via API.**
2. **Data is preprocessed and stored.**
3. **Fine-tuning pipeline is triggered for the user.**
4. **Personalized model is deployed, and API endpoint is provided to the user.**
5. **User interacts with their personalized chatbot via the provided API.**

### Technologies and Tools

- **Backend:** Python, Flask/FastAPI
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Data Storage:** AWS S3, PostgreSQL
- **Model Serving:** TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2, Docker, Kubernetes

By following this approach, you can create a scalable and flexible system that allows users to upload their data and get a personalized chatbot, all built on top of a robust base model.
