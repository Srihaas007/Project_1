# Project_1

The project aims to develop a sophisticated chatbot application leveraging LLaMA 3, an open-source language model from Facebook. This chatbot will be integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, enhancing its ability to generate relevant and context-aware responses by retrieving and utilizing pertinent information from a document repository. The backend, featuring the chatbot API, will be hosted on AWS to ensure scalability and reliability. Concurrently, a simple notice board will be developed using React Native to interact seamlessly with the chatbot. This collaborative effort involves backend development, DevOps for deployment, and frontend design, resulting in a robust, integrated solution for intelligent document processing and user interaction.
